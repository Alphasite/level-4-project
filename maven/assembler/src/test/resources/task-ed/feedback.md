# What did you think of it?
- Didnt think. Did.


# What do you think is missing in the documentation?
- If its used for less experienced students then the manual is missing the very fundamental concpets. 
	- How each thing does what.
	- Maybe an alternate format: i.e. ensure the explanation is next to the code

# What do you think is missing in the program?
- 

# What did you (or did not) like in the documentation?
- Manual did what it needed to at the end of the day
- Figure positioning was mucked up.
- Formatting is "low impedance"
- functional
- useful at this level and doesnt go into too many tangents
- Copy Pasting from the manual was a "bit of a bugger" because its a pdf, other formats might be better
- regular expressions weren't well explained but were mentioned with a vague unexplained example

# What did you (or did not) like in the program?
- Indenting.
- Tool assistance would be handy
- Error messages not clearly highlighting the problem area. They mention the problem but dont highlight it, 
  which makes it more difficult to track down. 
- mac config was different but fine.
- variable types were not completely clear/mildly confusing
- regex were incomprehensible

# Any other comments?
- No previous experience with typed languages
- Only python and a tiny bit of java
