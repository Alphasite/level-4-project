# What did you think of it?
- Easy to use (it is simple) and effective, but hard to get to know for a starter especially when I have not done much assembly before and it was years ago

# What do you think is missing in the documentation?
- More examples and explanation on how to use the system - what to type for size; are all fields optional or are they required/mandatory; 
maybe include some links to which regex 'system' is used; 
include the different options for variable types and other lists of information in case
they are not there (did not read the whole documentation, its long for a beginner) 

# What do you think is missing in the program?
- IntelliJ support for suggestions

# What do you absolutely not like in the documentation?
- Documentation is a bit abstract for a beginner.

# What do you absolutely not like in the program?
- spaces/indentation could be done automatically (through IntelliJ)

# Any other comments?
-
