# What do you think is missing in the documentation?
The documentation is good apart from the fact that it would be helpful to define the concepts of string matching.

# What did you (or did not) like in the program?
I think the naming is not very intuitive. It might reflect what is happening under the hood, but that is not entirely obvious to a programmer that simply wants to use the framework.
The syntax is fairly easy to read and would be easy to produce given a simplistic IDE without any smart indentation functions.
