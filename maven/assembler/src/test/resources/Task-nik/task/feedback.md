# What did you think of it?
-Could use a briefer and simpler tutorial with clearer run/show examples.

# What do you think is missing in the documentation?
-Config yaml is indentation-sensitive. What are the funny '\\' for? Are they part of the language?

# What do you think is missing in the program?
-Bananarama

# What do you absolutely not like in the documentation?
-Although funny, some more meaningful names would help.

# What do you absolutely not like in the program?
-YAML formatting is painful. Brackets would be easier.

# Any other comments?
-Tried to goto memory or label?
-Had to rush last parts.
