# What did you think of it?
- After some explanation, the instructions were easy enough to follow.
- main problem was wrestling with the formatting of yaml; 9/10 of my errors came from this, as opposed to doing something wrong elsewhere

# What do you think is missing in the documentation?
- Some kind of basic introduction for new users (although if the tool isn't really aimed at newbies then this doesn't really apply)
- an appendix that contains the full file; just to make formatting easier

# What do you think is missing in the program?
- Never used a program like this, so I wouldn't know what one should/shouldn't have
- maybe some form of error catching? (although if most of these errors are related to YAML, this is less relevant)

# What do you absolutely not like in the documentation?
- From my perspective, could have done with some spoon-feeding at the start

# What do you absolutely not like in the program?
- YAML.

# Any other comments?
- After some explanation, it was quite intuitive to work with
